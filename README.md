# Coding Exercises REPO

This is a place for me to store any kind of coding exercise/puzzle or side project I want. Currently there are only a couple python programs in it, but I plan to use it for a very long time, since I doubt there will ever be a point in my life where there isn't something
new to learn or to play around with.
