""" Valid Sudoku Exercise:

   Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

      Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

      Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

      Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

   Note:
      A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.

      Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

   Example 1:
      Input: board = 
                     [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
                     ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
                     ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
                     ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
                     ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
                     ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
                     ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
                     ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
                     ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
      Output: true

   Example 2:
      Input: board = 
                     [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
                     ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
                     ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
                     ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
                     ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
                     ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
                     ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
                     ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
                     ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
      Output: false
      
   Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

#Given an array containing 9 arrays of 9 ints from 1-9 as well as a "." if the space isn'f filled, we need to check that every element in said array is valid according to Sudoku's rules.

#IMPORT TOOLS ======================================================================================

import pprint #want this to print out the sudoku boards in more readable format

import copy #need a way to create an entirely new copy of the game board which will be altered first to avoid overwriting the actual game board, and ".copy()" isn't good enough for a list of lists

import itertools #need .permutations() in order to get each solver function to try every possible combo of numbers

import sys #using sys.exit() once board is filled either correctly or incorrectly to avoid the backwards recursive calls
